This a Snake Water Gun Game 

It is a beginner-friendly Java-Script game which requires minimal JS skills to create. 
the game is made by using "if-else" conditionals, a basic Snake, Water & Gun game. 
It is just like this popular game Rock, Paper & Scissors
Snake wins against water as it drinks the water, 
whereas water is effective against gun as water drowns the gun and hence wins. 
The snake loses against gun as the gun kills the snake. 
This is the basic understanding behind the game.
